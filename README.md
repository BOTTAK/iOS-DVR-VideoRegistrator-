DVR(VideoRegistrator)

Application for recording video on swipe on the screen. Capable of recording video clips of a given length.
- When swiping to the left, a video is recorded that happened in the past
- When swipe to the right, video recording will occur, which will happen in the future
- When swipe down, a video is recorded that will happen in the past and in the future

There are also settings in which you can set the duration of the recorded video, turn on the microphone or not, and the quality of the recorded video.

The main thing that is interesting here in terms of development is the overlay of dynamic data on the final visible file. In particular, mutable text.
